#Basic demonstration of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm use cases in removing frequencies from an audio file.

##Follow the demo/instructions in the interactive python notebook (.ipynb) file located in the repository. The .wav file is the audio waveform that will be modified. The .yml file includes dependencies required to run the python script. 

##If you do not already have conda installed, you can pip install individually the dependencies but it is not recommended. If you do have conda, create a conda environment with the given .yml file and activate it. Once it is activated, open up the .ipynb file.

**Commands: Navigate using command line into folder containing repository, and then run the following**
*conda env create -f FourierDependency.yml*
*conda activate FourierDependency*
*jupyter lab*
